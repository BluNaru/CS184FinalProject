    <p>Our project is to generate an interactive solar system with unique planets. Like a real solar system, our simulation would include a star, rocky planets, and gaseous planets, with the planets orbiting around the star. The user can interact with specific planets to explore the solar system. </p>

    <p>So far, our group has an editable model of a rocky planet. The planet’s colors, size, and terrain can be edited manually. We also have a working orbit for the planets in the solar system. An assortment of planets orbit around a star. In the planets’ orbit, the user can zoom in on a specific planet by selecting it from a dropdown menu. Gaseous planets are currently in progress, which when added, should be customizable similarly to the rocky planets. There is an option to add rings to gaseous planets, but we are still in the process of debugging the rings’ appearance. </p>

    <p>In our milestone video, we show our customizable rocky planets with changeable continents, terrains, etc. These planets are put into orbit around a star, where we are able to quickly zoom in on them. Within the orbit, an assortment of different planets can be seen in our solar system. Since we are still debugging gaseous planets, they were not included in the orbit demonstration. </p>

    <p>As of now, we still need to make sure all our components work together seamlessly. We only recently started incorporating the rocky planets into the orbit demo and created a working camera to easily view the solar system and specific planets. For gaseous planets, we need to debug the implementation of rings and apply a striped, gaseous texture to the planet itself so it is not a flat sphere. Once these components are completed and put together, we need to debug our code. At this point, the majority of our demo should be finished. With what we have completed now, we should be on schedule and can have a working solar system by the presentation deadline. </p>
